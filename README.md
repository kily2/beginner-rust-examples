# Rust Examples
I've been learning the basic syntax of Rust lately, and to help solidify my learning,
I coded basic programs, and have categorised them accordingly.

If you ever intend to learn Rust, you might find the code useful if you're starting off initially
and just want to look at sample code to do certain things. 

The great thing about Rust is that its overall design forces you to write clean code, and to make your program as fast as possible,
so hopefully my code is as clean as I can make it. Obviously, there are much faster ways of doing certain
things, but until I get to that point, I've got these basic programming constructs to work with for now.

I'm just using this repo to document my progress really. Feel free to add your own if you like!
